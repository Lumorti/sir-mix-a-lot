### History

A few years ago I made a [machine to mix cocktails](https://github.com/Lumorti/drink-182), but after testing that at a party I discovered a few things:

 - plumbing is hard, it leaked a lot
 - the cheap Raspberry Pi touchscreen was quite hard to press
 - flow rates exist, people don't want to wait 10 minutes for a drink
 - it being gravity fed meant that the timings/pressures weren't constant at all
 - giving drunk people a long list of cocktails is too much pressure
 - making things out of wood is a lot of physical effort

So here I present the revised version: Sir Mix-a-Lot (no relation). This time it uses just an Arduino for simplicity, only uses four liquids for cost reasons, uses dials to choose the ratios rather than a touchscreen, and the pumps are peristalic meaning they don't need to be gravity fed. All of this housed inside a nice premade box.
